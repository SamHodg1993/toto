# Todo CLI App

A simple command-line interface (CLI) application for managing your daily tasks and todo items. This is currently and will always be (while under my control) a FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) application.

## Why?
- Why toto?
The reason is simple really, every developer at some point will write a todo app, probably more than one. For some reason, whenever I want to write todo, my fingers type toto. It's simple, it's (probably) unique, so I went with it. 
- Why another todo cli tool?
I just kinda wanted to. None of the other tools really fitted what I wanted it to be, plus, I wanted another Golang project.
- What makes toto special?
Right now, just that we base projects around the current working directory. Soon though, we will be adding Monday.com and Jira integrations!!!

## Features

- Add new tasks
- List all tasks
- List project tasks
- Mark tasks as complete
- Delete tasks
- Edit title and description information
- Reset the database
- Projects based on the current working directory
- **Jira API token authentication** - Securely authenticate with Jira using API tokens
- Simple and intuitive command-line interface
- Build so you spend less time planning...

## Installation

### For Users (Recommended)
```bash
# Install directly with Go (requires Go 1.21+)
# Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux
go install github.com/samhodg1993/toto@latest
```

### Ensuring `toto` is in your PATH

After installation, make sure `$GOPATH/bin` (typically `$HOME/go/bin`) is in your PATH.

**Check if it's already in your PATH:**
```bash
echo $PATH | grep go/bin
```

**If not, add it to your shell configuration:**

**Bash** (add to `~/.bashrc`):
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/go/bin:$PATH"
```

**Zsh** (add to `~/.zshrc`):
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/go/bin:$PATH"
```

**Fish** (add to `~/.config/fish/config.fish`):
```fish
set -gx PATH $HOME/go/bin $PATH
```

**Then reload your shell:**
```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc, or restart your terminal
```

The `toto` command will now be available globally.

## Usage

When using these commands, by default, they will only get the todo's that exist for a project which has been linked to the current working directory unless you use either the lsla command or the list-long command with the -A flag!

```bash
# Add a new task
toto add -t <"Title of the todo" (required)> -d <"Description of the todo" (optional)> -c <"Created time" (optional)> -u <"updated time" (optional)>

# List all tasks
toto list
# OR the shorthand version 
toto ls

# List all tasks with more detail
toto list-long (with optional -A flag)
# OR the shorthand version 
toto lsl
# OR for all todos regardless of project 
toto lsla

# Edit a todo
toto edit -i <todo-id (required)> -t <"New title" (optional)> -d <"New description" (optional)> 

# Mark task as complete (single)
toto toggle-complete -i <task-id>
# Or the shorthand
toto comp -i <task-id>

# Mark multiple tasks as complete (bulk)
toto comp -I 1,2,3,4

# Clear the completed todos for the current project
toto remove-complete
# Or the shorthand
toto cls-comp

# Clean: clear screen, remove completed, and list remaining todos
toto clean
# With optional -r flag to reverse list order
toto clean -r

# Delete a task (single)

# Reset the database
# the confirm flag is optional, if it does not exist, you will be prompted to confirm the action
toto reset -confirm(optional) 

# List projects 
toto proj-ls 
# Or the shorthand 
toto prls

## Examples

Add a new task with a description:
```bash
toto add -t "Implement login feature" -d "Add user authentication to the API"
```

List tasks in current project:
```bash
toto ls
```

List tasks in reverse order (newest first):
```bash
toto ls -r
```

List detailed tasks with full dates:
```bash
toto lsl -D
```

Mark task as complete:
```bash
toto comp -i 1
```

Mark multiple tasks as complete (bulk):
```bash
toto comp -I 1,2,3,4
```

Clean up completed tasks and display remaining:
```bash
toto clean
```

Clean up and display remaining tasks in reverse order:
```bash
toto clean -r
```

**Jira Integration Examples:**

Authenticate with Jira:
```bash
toto jira-auth
```
You'll be prompted to enter your Jira URL, email, and API token (create one at https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens). Your credentials are validated and securely stored in your OS keyring.

Pull a Jira ticket and create a todo:
```bash
toto jira-pull -i PROJ-123
```

Pull a Jira ticket and break it into subtasks with AI:
```bash
toto jira-pull-claude -i PROJ-123
```
This uses Claude AI to intelligently break down the ticket into actionable subtasks. If the description contains a bulleted list, it extracts each item. Otherwise, it analyzes the ticket and creates 3-8 subtasks.

## Roadmap

### Completed ✅
- ✅ **Jira integration** - OAuth authentication, ticket fetching, and AI-powered breakdown
- ✅ **LLM Integration (Phase 1)** - Claude API for Jira ticket breakdown into subtasks

### Planned Features
- **Terminal UI (TUI)** - Interactive browser for Jira tickets and todos (lazygit-style)
- **LLM Integration (Phase 2)** - Additional AI features:
  - Auto-generate titles from brief descriptions
  - Improve/rename existing todos
  - Expand descriptions with context
  - Suggest criticality levels and completion order
- **Jira Push/Sync** - Create Jira tickets from todos and sync status
- **Priority/Criticality System** - Add priority levels for todos
- **Monday.com integration** - Similar integration to Jira
- **github.com integration** - Similar integration to Jira

## Jira Integration Setup

Jira integration is fully functional with simple API token authentication and AI-powered ticket breakdown!

### Current Status
✅ **Completed:**
- API token authentication (no OAuth app creation needed!)
- Secure credential storage in OS keyring
- Direct Jira URL support (works with any Jira instance)
- Database schema for Jira tickets
- REST API client for fetching individual tickets
- ADF (Atlassian Document Format) description parsing (supports bullet lists, ordered lists, etc.)
- `jira-pull` command - Fetch ticket and create linked todo
- `jira-pull-claude` command - AI-powered ticket breakdown using Claude Sonnet

🚧 **Coming Soon:**
- `toto jira-push -i <todo-id>` - Create Jira ticket from todo
- `toto jira-sync` - Sync status between todos and Jira

### Setup

1. **Create a Jira API token:**
   - Go to: https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens
   - Click "Create API token"
   - Give it a name (e.g., "Toto CLI")
   - Copy the token immediately (you won't see it again!)

2. **Authenticate with Jira:**
   ```bash
   toto jira-auth
   ```
   You'll be prompted to enter:
   - Your Jira URL (e.g., `https://mycompany.atlassian.net`)
   - Your email address
   - Your API token

   Credentials are validated with a test API call and securely stored in your OS keyring.

3. **Pull a Jira ticket:**
   ```bash
   toto jira-pull -i PROJ-123
   ```
   Fetches the ticket from Jira, saves it to the database, and creates a linked todo.

4. **Pull a Jira ticket with AI breakdown:**
   ```bash
   toto jira-pull-claude -i PROJ-123
   ```
   Uses Claude AI to intelligently break down the ticket into multiple subtasks.

   **Note:** Requires `CLAUDE_API_KEY` environment variable. Export it in your shell:
   ```bash
   export CLAUDE_API_KEY=your-claude-api-key
   ```

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or higher
- Git (for development)
- SQLite3 (automatically handled by Go modules)
- **For Jira integration:** Jira account with API access
- **For AI features:** Anthropic API key (get one at https://console.anthropic.com/)
